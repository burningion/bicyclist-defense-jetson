# WIP - ROS2 Containers

Taking ROS2 and the NVIDIA containers for a spin, looking to see how well the ROS2 ecosystem will fit with some of the challenges of data collection.

I've currently got the [ROS2 TI mmWave](https://github.com/kimsooyoung/mmwave_ti_ros) package installed in the [ROS2 Humble docker distribution](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/isaac/containers/ros) from NVIDIA.
